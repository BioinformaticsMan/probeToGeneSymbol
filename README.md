## The demo GEO datasets was GSE131617, You can download the dataset from the link https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi
## matrixFile=ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE131nnn/GSE131617/matrix/GSE131617-GPL5175_series_matrix.txt.gz
## familyFile=ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE131nnn/GSE131617/soft/GSE131617_family.soft.gz
## GEO access may be unstable, please try a few more times or switch to a VPN.
## Please unzip the above file and put it together with the "probeToGeneSymbol.py" script. 
## If you want to try to process other data sets, you may need to adjust some of the parameters in the *.py and run.sh file according to the matrix and family files. Good luck! XD
